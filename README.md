# Plus Un Zeste !

You are a lemon trapped in Pedro's kitchen, find the open and escape !

But be careful, this kitchen is not up to health and safety standards! : Knives, rot, flames and other dangers await you around the corner.

And you thought you could roll peacefully through the kitchen? Pedro hates when his fruits try to escape ! Hide from him or he will make a lemonade out of you !

Your goal is to find the open window in the level and exit.

The window is always at the end of the level.

Knives and forks, rot, flames deals you damages on contact.

If you fall on the ground, you will die !

If Pedro sees you, his view will appear in the top right corner of the screen and you will take damages until you hide from him.

When you hide, you have to wait a bit for Pedro to lose patience and walk away. His view will then disappear.

When a gas cooker hood is on you will be lifted in the air.

There are 4 different levels, have fun beating them !

Tips

Lemons don't have really strong muscles but if you spam your jump you can climb small slopes and roll a bit faster !
